# Voice Project
 My Capstone Project - covers fluency of speakers

Audio files must be in *.wav format, recorded at 44 kHz sample frame and 16 bits of resolution.
YOU MUST SPEAK RIGHT NEXT TO THE MICROPHONE, OTHERWISE THIS DOESN"T WORK

Audacity is a good tool to use for recording at the exact specifications.

TODO: 
Further testing is needed for longer audio clips, and trying to see what it interprets emotions as is also important.
