# Voice Project
My Capstone Project - covers fluency of speakers

Audio files must be in *.wav format, recorded at 48 kHz sample frame and 24-32 bits of resolution. Record in MONO, HyperX Microphone capable of 24 bits of resolution
YOU MUST SPEAK RIGHT NEXT TO THE MICROPHONE, OTHERWISE THIS DOESN"T WORK

Audacity is a good tool to use for recording at the exact specifications.

1. This project will analyze a recording of a speaker and determine fluency.

2. Installation requires installing myprosody. Do this through mypip and use mysp=__import__("myprosody") instead of import myprosody (if installed through mypip)

3. As of right now, you can use the program to determine gender of the speaker, and a couple of other things. 

4. You can test it by using the recordings in the Voice Recordings folder.

5. I am using the myprosody library made by the MySolutions lab.

The structure of this repository is the folder with all the myprosody information in it, and a voice recordings file in that folder. Also, a small reading test to really stress the power of the program. The current state of this project is unfinished, with a lot of work left to do.
