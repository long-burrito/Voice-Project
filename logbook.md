November 9th: Transformed the Pandas dataframe of prosodic values from being separated by columns to being separated by rows to make it easy to compare the average prosodic values to the ones collected by the voice-program.py with the provided audio file. I dropped values that correlate with the length of time spoken to avoid any bias, as making it longer could potentially mess with any comparisons made.
